# Anomaly-Detection-in-Beehive-Environmental-Data-Autoencoder-ML-Methods-
This project explores unsupervised anomaly detection in environmental sensor data collected from a beehive. We apply both traditional ML algorithms (One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest) and a deep learning Autoencoder to detect unusual patterns in temperature and humidity readings.
